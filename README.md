# About Failory:

Launched on Product Hunt and quickly became my favorite corner on the Internet, Failory helps founders and makers build succesful Internet businesses by showing the reasons why many startups have failed while others succeed, and (would love to see this implemented) resources for founders and makers to prevent it.

By looking up the founders and employees of failed startups featured on Failory, I realized that they are doing pretty well being managers and tech leads of businesses they are in. The biggest fear, fear of failure, stopping founders and makers starting their own things doesn't seem so scary, failures are valuable.
